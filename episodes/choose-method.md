:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What distinguishes any method from another, i.e. are ther different method types?
-How will learners know which methods are the right ones for their research?
- What ethical considerations do learners need to take into account when choosing a method? 
- How does the research plan effect method selection?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

* Define a target audience for the user study
* Identify risks of participation in a study and ways of addressing those
* Develop an appropriate recruitment strategy based on the chosen target audience
* Create an outreach plan and craft relevant materials (including screener, emails, etc)

Lesson content goes here

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

1. Define your project
  * Describe your tool/software
  * State one usability goal (e.g. reduce user errors during form completion)
  * List your project's constraints
2. Brainstorm
  * List all possible methods you know / recall
  * Use cheat sheet as a reference
3. Filter & Select 
  * Narrow your list to 5 methods that your team thinks best fits your project's constraints and goals
  * Evaluate each method choosen against checklist/rubric??? (idk rn)
4. Reflect
  * Finalize your list
  * Write a sentence per method explaining why it fits in your project

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?

```r
paste("This", "new", "lesson", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
```output
[1] "This new lesson looks good"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

![You belong in The Carpentries!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/logo/master/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Presenting research method types, i.e. qualitative vs. quantative and attitudinal vs. behavioral.
- Introducing frameworks for method selection and considering constraints.
