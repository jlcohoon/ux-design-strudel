::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

* Some combination of leveraging transcription tools, partnering with a note taker, and reflecting on your session after it is concluded can ensure you have useful notes to use later
* Asking strategic follow up questions and leveraging a well developed interview protocol can help you get more information without losing track of your conversational thread
* Whether or not you have enough data depends on factors like your available time and resources, how likely you are to iterate on this topic, and how useful the insights you have gathered already are to you
